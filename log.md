# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23 November 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started freeCodeCamp, Responsive Web Design Certification. Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 and began Basic CSS

**Thoughts:** Most material so far is review from WSCC Web Development classes. Looking forward to more advanced topics.
